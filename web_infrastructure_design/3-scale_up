Components Explained
1. Additional Server (Load Balancer Cluster)
Why Add This?

Ensures high availability and fault tolerance.
If the primary load balancer fails, the secondary load balancer automatically takes over.
2. Split Components
Why Split Web Server, Application Server, and Database?

Improved Performance: Each server specializes in its task, reducing bottlenecks.
Scalability: Easier to scale individual components independently (e.g., add more web servers for increased traffic).
Security: Database servers are isolated, reducing exposure to attacks.
Load Balancer Role
Distributes traffic among web servers using algorithms like Round Robin or Least Connections.
Enhances the systemâ€™s performance and ensures even distribution of requests.
Web Server Role
Manages static assets (e.g., images, CSS, JS).
Acts as a reverse proxy for requests to the application server.
Application Server Role
Processes dynamic requests, such as user authentication or database queries.
Database Server Role
Stores persistent data like user accounts, content, or transactions.
